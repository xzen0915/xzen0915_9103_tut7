__Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration__  
_This inspiration came from a programming subject I previously studied called Processing, specifically the random walk algorithm in Processing. By simulating particles emanating from a specific point and gradually diminishing over time until they disappear, this method vividly demonstrates dynamics and fluidity. In team tasks, this approach can be used to dynamically display unique elements of selected artworks, such as color gradients and shape transformations, enhancing visual effects and the viewer's interactive experience._

__Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration__  
_Processing coding techniques, by simulating a particle system, achieve a visual effect where particles originate from the location clicked by the user. The position of these particles randomly shifts based on the Perlin noise function, simulating a natural movement effect. The color of the particles depends on the pixel colors of the underlying image. Over time, each particle gradually diminishes in size and eventually disappears. It creates a dynamic and interactive visual display, where the motion and color changes of the particles produce a unique artistic effect. Thus, through this technology, we can create smoother and more organic animations._
